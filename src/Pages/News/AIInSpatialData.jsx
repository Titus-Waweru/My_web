          Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the way we analyze, predict, and visualize geospatial data.
          By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, we can unlock insights that were previously impossible to discover at scale.

        <p className="text-lg mb-8 leading-relaxed">
          Techniques such as <strong>Random Forests</strong>, <strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</strong>, and
          deep learning enable the detection of land use changes, optimization of site selection, and monitoring of urban growth ‚Äî all in real-time.
